# ComSci319-Final
This app was created as a final project for ComSci 319. My final project was a watch catalog. The functions of this website is to add, remove, showall, and update watches. All this information is stored in a MongoDB database, and any changes made to products are updated there. 
This website uses Mongo, Express, React, and Node.js.

To run the app, open 2 windows of VScode (front end and back end) and run: npm start in both directories.

To install the dependancies: run npm install before running npm start
